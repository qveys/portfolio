        description: 'A data engineer is a professional who specializes in designing, building, and managing the infrastructure required to store, process, and route data within an organization. Unlike data analysts or data scientists, who focus on data analysis, the data engineer\'s role is focused on creating data pipelines and implementing systems to effectively use that data. Data engineers work with complex data architectures to ensure that the data collected is reliable, accessible, and ready for further analysis. They are responsible for managing large volumes of data (big data), transforming it, and integrating it into databases or data warehouses.',
